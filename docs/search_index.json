The model is based on a linear mixed effects framework that accounts for spatial and temporal correlations using a hierachical Bayesian structure. Letcher et al. (2016) describe the initial development of this model framework, and apply it to a small region in western Massachusetts. See the Model Overview section below for a brief introduction to the model, or the Theory section a more detailed explanation. The documentation is divided into the following sections: Introduction : provides an overview the stream temperature model and documentation, as well as a snapshot of the current calibration Theory : describes how the model works including the underlying structure and theory Data Sources : describes the datasets used as inputs to the model Data Processing : describes how input datasets are processed prior to model fitting (i.e.Â QAQC procedures) Calibration and Validation : describes how well the model predicts stream temperature based on observations that were included (calibration) and excluded (validation) from the model fitting process Predictions : describes how predictions are generated after the model is calibrated and describes the various summary metrics that are computed for each catchment Download : provides links to download the model predictions, catchment delineation (shapefiles), and covariates dataset. The model will be periodically updated and re-calibrated (approximately once every 6 months) to incorporate any new temperature observations, and to make any necessary revisions to the data processing and/or model structure. With each update, a new version will be assigned to the model, and this documentation website will be updated to reflect the most recent performance of the model. A brief summary of the changes associated with each new version is provided in the Change Log below. 1.1 Model Overview The SHEDS stream temperature model predicts daily mean stream temperature based on geospatial characteristics and daily weather conditions. Predictions are made at a relatively fine spatial resolution based on a customized catchment delineation (average size about 2 km2) across the northeast U.S. from Maine to Virginia. Predictions are limited to streams and rivers with drainage areas less than 200 km2. Heavily impounded rivers are also excluded from the model. The model uses a hierarchical Bayesian structure to account for spatial correlation in temperature between near-by locations through random effects for both the individual catchments and the larger watershed (HUC8) containing that catchment. Therefore, catchments within the same HUC8 watershed share a set of HUC-specific coefficients. Year to year variations in temperature are also accounted for using a random effect for the year. 1.2 Current Snapshot Table 1.1 provides a snapshot of the calibration and validation performance for the current version of the model (v1.3.0). More details about the model performance can be found in the Calibration and Validation section.

Y is the minor version, which will be incremented when there is a new set of results due to changes in the model code, datasets, processing procedures, etc. Z is the patch version, which will be incremented only when there is a change to the documentation or code that does not yield different results. 1.4 Source Code The source code for the model itself and this documentation is available in the Github repository walkerjeffd/sheds-temp-model.

["theory.html", "Section 2 Theory 2.1 Fixed Effects 2.2 Catchment Random Effects 2.3 HUC Random Effects 2.4 Year Random Effects", " Section 2 Theory The stream temperature model is a nested hierarchical Bayesian model that predicts daily stream temperature based on catchment characteristics and climate conditions. An early version of this model can be found in Letcher et al. (2016). Daily mean stream temperature for each catchment is assumed to be a normally distributed random variable: \\[t_{h,c,y,d} \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mu_{h,c,y,d},\\sigma_{[t]})\\] where \\(t_{h,c,y,d}\\) is the mean stream temperature on day \\(d\\) within year \\(y\\) for catchment \\(c\\), which is located within HUC8 \\(h\\). This random variable is normally distributed with an expected mean \\(\\mu_{h,c,y,d}\\) and standard deviation \\(\\sigma_{[t]}\\). The expected mean is computed as: \\[ \\mu_{h,c,y,d} = \\left \\{ \\begin{array}{l l} \\omega_{h,c,y,d} + \\delta_{h}(t_{h,c,y,d-1} - \\omega_{h,c,y,d-1}) &amp; \\quad \\text{for } t_{h,c,y,d-1} \\text{ is real} \\\\ \\omega_{h,c,y,d} &amp; \\quad \\text{for } t_{h,c,y,d-1} \\text{ is not real} \\end{array} \\right. \\] where \\(\\delta_h\\) is an autoregressive [AR(1)] coefficient and \\(\\omega_{h,c,y,d}\\) is the expected temperature before accounting for temporal autocorrelation in the error structure. The expected temperature is computed as a linear equation with four sets of terms: \\[\\omega_{h,c,y,d} = X_{[0]} B_{[0]} + X_{h,c} B_{h,c} + X_{h} B_{h} + X_{y} B_{y}\\] where \\(B_{[0]}\\) is a vector of fixed effect coefficients \\(B_{h,c}\\) is a vector of random effect coefficients for catchment \\(c\\) \\(B_{h}\\) is a vector of random effect coefficients for HUC \\(h\\) \\(B_{y}\\) is a vector of random effect coefficients for year \\(y\\) Each of these vectors is multiplied by a corresponding matrix containing the corresponding predictor values (\\(X\\)) of each catchment \\(c\\) (located within HUC \\(h\\)) and on each day \\(d\\) (within year \\(y\\)). 2.1 Fixed Effects The fixed effects are shared among all catchments within the model domain.

Processing of the raw stream temperature observations involves the following steps: Screen monitoring stations based on location and drainage area characteristics Aggregate instantaneous observations to daily time steps Screen daily mean temperature values and time series according to various QA/QC tests Aggregate daily time series measured at multiple stations within a single catchment Screen time series to exclude cold weather conditions when air temperature and water temperature are de-coupled Split the final dataset into subsets for calibration (90% of time series) and validation (10% of time series) 4.1 Screen Monitoring Stations The full set of monitoring stations are first screened to exclude those that meet the following criteria: Located within 100 m of an impoundment Located within a tidal zone Located within a catchment having a drainage area greater than 200 sq km Located within a catchment having a drainage area with greater than 50% coverage by open water or wetlands 4.2 Screen Daily Mean Values After screening for the monitoring stations, the remaining time series are screened according to the following criteria: Remove daily values that have user-defined flag stored in the database Remove daily values with mean temp &lt; -25 degC Remove daily values with mean or max temp &gt; 35 degC Remove time series with a high correlation between daily mean water and air temperature, which are suspected to be measurements of air temperature Remove time series with fewer than 5 days of observations Remove first and/or last day of each timeseries if the number of observations on those days is less than the median number of observations per day for the whole series (i.e.Â the first and/or last day are incomplete) 4.3 Combine Overlapping Timeseries If there are two or more overlapping time series at a single monitoring station, then those time series are combined by: Compute the overall mean value on each date of the overlapping time series. Remove any daily values having more than one time series and a difference in mean observed temperature greater than 5 deg C between those time series 4.4 Screen Multiple Locations within Single Catchment If there are multiple stations within a single catchment, then only one station is retained to represent that catchment based on the following criteria: Exclude stations located more than 60 m from the main flowline of the catchment If more than one station remains, choose the stations with greatest number of observations between April and October If more than one station still remains, choose the station located nearest to the pour point of the catchment 4.5 Remove Cold Weather Periods Lastly, each time series are truncated to the seasonal period during which water temperature and air temperature are coupled to exclude observations during cold weather periods. 4.6 Split Dataset for Calibration and Validation The final dataset of mean daily stream temperature observations are then split for calibration and validation. The split is performed by randomly selecting 90% of the time series for calibration, and using the remaining 10% for validation. "],

["predictions.html", "Section 6 Predictions 6.1 Air Temperature Scenarios", " Section 6 Predictions Once calibrated, the model is used to generate stream temperature predictions for all catchments in the region having drainage areas less than 200 sq km and less than 70% open water coverage. First, daily time series of predicted mean temperature are generated for each catchment. The daily predictions are then aggregated by year by calculated various metrics such as mean monthly temperatures and frequencies of exceeding various thresholds. Lastly, the annual temperature metrics are aggregated by catchment over all years in the historical period of record. For each catchment, predictions are generated by the following steps: Calculate the predicted daily mean stream temperature for each year in the historical period of record (1980 - 2020) during the months of June, July and August For each month and year, calculate the following metrics: Mean monthly temperature (June, July, August) Mean and maximum summer temperature (June 1 - August 31) Maximum 30-day rolling mean temperature Number of days with temperature exceeding 18, 20, and 22 deg C Resistivity computed as the sum of the absolute difference between the predicted stream temperature and the daily mean air temperature (June 1 to August 31) For each catchment, the annual metrics from the previous step are aggregated by calculating the following metrics over all years: Mean monthly (June, July, August) and summer (June 1 - August 31) temperature Mean and maximum of the annual maximum summer temperature Mean of the annual maximum 30-dy rolling mean temperature Mean number of days per year exceeding 18, 20, and 22 deg C Mean resistivity Figure 6.1 shows the distribution (histogram) of each final metric for all catchments. Figure 6.1: Distributions of Catchment Derived Metrics 6.1 Air Temperature Scenarios Beginning with v1.1.1, the prediction metrics described above are generated for a series of climate change scenarios with air temperatures increasing by 2, 4, and 6 degC. These scenarios are calculated by increasing each daily air temperature by the respective amount. In other words, these scenarios assume a uniform increase in air temperature, which does not vary seasonally. Figure 6.2 shows the distribution of mean July stream temperature among all catchments for each air temperature scenario.
