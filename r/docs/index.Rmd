# Introduction {#intro}

The SHEDS stream temperature model was developed to predict daily stream temperatures at both gaged and un-gaged catchments across the northeast U.S. based on geospatial characteristics and weather conditions.

The model is based on a linear mixed effects framework that accounts for spatial and temporal correlations using a hierachical Bayesian structure. @Letcher2016 describe the initial development of this model framework, and apply it to a small region in western Massachusetts. See the [Model Overview] section below for a brief introduction to the model, or the [Theory] section a more detailed explanation.

The documentation is divided into the following sections:

1. [Introduction] : provides an overview the stream temperature model and documentation, as well as a snapshot of the current calibration
1. [Theory] : describes how the model works including the underlying structure and theory
1. [Data Sources] : describes the datasets used as inputs to the model
1. [Data Processing] : describes how input datasets are processed prior to model fitting (i.e. QAQC procedures) 
1. [Calibration and Validation] : describes how well the model predicts stream temperature based on observations that were included (calibration) and excluded (validation) from the model fitting process
1. [Predictions] : describes how predictions are generated after the model is calibrated and describes the various summary metrics that are computed for each catchment
1. [Download] : provides links to download the model predictions, catchment delineation (shapefiles), and covariates dataset.

The model will be periodically updated and re-calibrated (approximately once every 6 months) to incorporate any new temperature observations, and to make any necessary revisions to the data processing and/or model structure. With each update, a new version will be assigned to the model, and this documentation website will be updated to reflect the most recent performance of the model. A brief summary of the changes associated with each new version is provided in the [Change Log](#change-log) below.

## Model Overview

The SHEDS stream temperature model predicts daily mean stream temperature based on geospatial characteristics and daily weather conditions. Predictions are made at a relatively fine spatial resolution based on a customized catchment delineation (average size about 2 km^2^) across the northeast U.S. from Maine to Virginia. Predictions are limited to streams and rivers with drainage areas less than 200 km^2^. Heavily impounded rivers are also excluded from the model.

The model uses a hierarchical Bayesian structure to account for spatial correlation in temperature between near-by locations through random effects for both the individual catchments and the larger watershed (HUC8) containing that catchment. Therefore, catchments within the same HUC8 watershed share a set of HUC-specific coefficients. Year to year variations in temperature are also accounted for using a random effect for the year.

## Current Snapshot

Table \@ref(tab:table-intro-gof) provides a snapshot of the calibration and validation performance for the current version of the model (v`r config$version`). More details about the model performance can be found in the [Calibration and Validation] section.

## Model Versioning

The SHEDS stream temperature model uses semantic versioning of the form: `vX.Y.Z`

- `X` is the **major** version, which will be incremented when there is a major change to the model theory, code, or datasets.
- `Y` is the **minor** version, which will be incremented when there is a new set of results due to changes in the model code, datasets, processing procedures, etc.
- `Z` is the **patch** version, which will be incremented only when there is a change to the documentation or code that *does not* yield different results.

## Source Code

The source code for the model itself and this documentation is available in the Github repository [walkerjeffd/sheds-temp-model](https://github.com/walkerjeffd/sheds-temp-model). Each version of the model will be included under the list of  [Releases](https://github.com/walkerjeffd/sheds-temp-model/releases).
