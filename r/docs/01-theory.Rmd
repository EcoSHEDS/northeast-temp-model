The stream temperature model is a nested hierarchical Bayesian model that predicts daily stream temperature based on catchment characteristics and climate conditions. An early version of this model can be found in @Letcher2016.

Daily mean stream temperature for each catchment is assumed to be a normally distributed random variable:

$$t_{h,c,y,d} \sim \mathcal{N}(\mu_{h,c,y,d},\sigma_{[t]})$$

where $t_{h,c,y,d}$ is the mean stream temperature on day $d$ within year $y$ for catchment $c$, which is located within HUC8 $h$. This random variable is normally distributed with an expected mean $\mu_{h,c,y,d}$ and standard deviation $\sigma_{[t]}$.

The expected mean is computed as:

$$
\mu_{h,c,y,d} = \left \{ \begin{array}{l l}
  \omega_{h,c,y,d} + \delta_{h}(t_{h,c,y,d-1} - \omega_{h,c,y,d-1}) & \quad \text{for } t_{h,c,y,d-1} \text{ is real} \\
  \omega_{h,c,y,d} & \quad \text{for } t_{h,c,y,d-1} \text{ is not real}
  \end{array} \right.
$$

where $\delta_h$ is an autoregressive [AR(1)] coefficient and $\omega_{h,c,y,d}$ is the expected temperature before accounting for temporal autocorrelation in the error structure.

The expected temperature is computed as a linear equation with four sets of terms:

$$\omega_{h,c,y,d} = X_{[0]} B_{[0]} + X_{h,c} B_{h,c} + X_{h} B_{h} + X_{y} B_{y}$$

where

- $B_{[0]}$ is a vector of fixed effect coefficients
- $B_{h,c}$ is a vector of random effect coefficients for catchment $c$
- $B_{h}$ is a vector of random effect coefficients for HUC $h$
- $B_{y}$ is a vector of random effect coefficients for year $y$

Each of these vectors is multiplied by a corresponding matrix containing the corresponding predictor values of each catchment $c$ and on each day $d$.
